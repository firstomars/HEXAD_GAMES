    tipList:
    - Circadian rhythms are your bodies internal clocks, the most important is your
      'sleep-wake' cycle.
    - Your chronotype, or when your body prefers to sleep is genetic. It can be trained
      but it is built into your body clock.
    - Sleep plays a role in our physical wellness but also affects our concentration,
      memory, and ability to learn new things.
    - Avoiding caffine after 6pm can aid in falling asleep later in the night. Coffee,
      energy drinks, black and green tea, and chocolate all contain caffine.
    - Studies have linked an increase in risk taking behaviour by young adults with
      anxiety and poor sleep behaviour.
    - Studies of students with academic excellence showed they had earlier bedtimes
      than students with poor grades.
    - The average 18-25 year old needs 7-9 hours of sleep a day. In fact all adults
      need the same amount of sleep.
  - tipType: 1NightBadSleep
    tipList:
    - While not recommended, it is possible to catch up on sleep slowly with an extra
      1 or 2 hours a night. But the debt must be paid!
    - If you have had a night of bad sleep, research suggests that a brief day time
      nap of 20 minutes may be enough to restore alertfulness.
  - tipType: 2NightBadSleep
    tipList:
    - Disrupted or lack of sleep has been linked to our abaility to manage emotions,
      anxiety levels, and can even lead to depression.
    - Your cardiovascular system and cholesterol levels can suffer long term effects
      from sleep deprevation.
    - Your bodies metabolism is linked to your sleep-wake cycle and not getting enough
      sleep can affect your bodies ability to manage serum and glucose leading to
      a high BMI score (weight gain).
  - tipType: ExerciseAfter6
    tipList:
    - Exercise in the evening is not recommended for most people as it increases
      your body temperature and effects the hormones that promote sleep.
  - tipType: EraticLogin
    tipList:
    - "Your circadain rhythm is just that, a rhythm. It expects you to go to bed
      at the same time every night\u2026 even on weekends."
  - tipType: LoginAfterBedtime
    tipList:
    - Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD) is where you fight your body clock to go
      to sleep later. This affects your circadian rhythm and may require treatment.
  - tipType: BlueLightFilter
    tipList:
    - Blue light from LED screens supresses your bodies production of melatonin,
      the hormone that promotes sleep.
    - Cutting back on screen time for an hour before sleep can increase production
      of the hormone melatonin helping to promote sleep.
